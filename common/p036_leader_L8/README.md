# p036_leader_L8 Codility problem from Lesson 8
---

Let us consider a sequence a0, a1,...,an≠1. The leader of this sequence is the element whose
value occurs more than n
2 times.
a0 a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6
6 8 4 6 8 6 6
0 1 2 3 4 5 6
In the picture the leader is highlighted in gray. Notice that the sequence can have at most one
leader. If there were two leaders then their total occurrences would be more than 2 · n
2 = n,
but we only have n elements.
The leader may be found in many ways. We describe some methods here, starting with
trivial, slow ideas and ending with very creative, fast algorithms. The task is to find the value
of the leader of the sequence a0, a1,...,an≠1, such that 0 ˛ ai ˛ 109. If there is no leader,
the result should be -1.
